Missing class properties transform.
need to fix the damn babel class thing
actually need to switch to class implementation
should the toJS method return a js representation of the entire thing?
or just the last node?
working on remove from index
would 2d array storage make more sense than linkedlist?
do shift and unshift still make sense?
